# Sorting Algorithms and Regression Prediction in C

This project implements sorting algorithms and regression prediction in C programming language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler like GCC

### Compilation and Execution

To compile the program:
```bash
gcc -o app.exe main.c
```

To execute the program :
### Windows:
```bash
./main.exe
```
### Linux:
```bash
main.exe
```
### Sorting Algorithms
- With the programm you can compare algorithms of sorting and know how they interact.
